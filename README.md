# -PhD_influence_impurity_defect_solubility_diffusion_oxygen-
Part of my work realized during the years as a PhD student. I was in the team MEMO of the CIRIMAT lab in Toulouse. I study via a multi-scale approach the influence influence of H, C, N impurities and point defects on the solubility and diffusion of the oxygen in the nickel (fcc phase). My works was under the supervision of Damien Conn√©table and Daniel Monceau.
